# Web Fuzzer - Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

**Web Fuzzer** is a powerful web vulnerability scanner designed to identify common security issues on websites. It performs checks on headers, technologies used, potential vulnerabilities, and open ports, providing insights to help enhance web application security. Whether you are a developer, security researcher, or system administrator, this tool can assist in identifying and mitigating web security risks.

## Features

- **Website Header Scanning**: Analyzes response headers for common security flaws.
- **Technology Detection**: Identifies technologies used by a website, such as CMS, frameworks, and servers.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Scans for vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Local File Inclusion (LFI), and more.
- **Port Scanning**: Detects open ports to identify potential attack vectors.
- **Security Recommendations**: Provides actionable security advice based on scan results.

## Security Recommendations

After scanning a website, **Web Fuzzer** provides a detailed list of security best practices, such as:

- **Input Validation**: Always sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent XSS, SQL Injection, and other attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS to ensure data encryption.
- **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your software and dependencies up-to-date.
- **Disable Unused Ports**: Close unnecessary open ports.
